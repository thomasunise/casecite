"""Matter & membership models.

A Matter is the unit of collaboration and isolation. Every user owns a personal
matter (``is_personal=True``, created on demand) that holds their private work;
additional matters can be created and shared with colleagues by adding members.

Access to a resource is "is the current user a member of the resource's matter?"
— the personal matter has exactly one member (its owner), so a single-user
install behaves identically to the previous per-user isolation model. Membership
generalizes that: an ethical wall later becomes an exclusion on a matter, and an
org becomes a grouping over matters, both without reworking this spine.
