"""Shared FastAPI dependency for matter-scoped access.

Resolves the set of matters the caller may access (their personal matter plus
any shared matters they belong to). Injected into resource reads so a member
sees content shared with them via a matter. Depends only on authentication —
each endpoint's own require_permission still gates the action.
