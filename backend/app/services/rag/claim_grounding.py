"""Claim-level grounding for chat answers over the user's documents.

Chunk citations explain retrieval, not the answer — "this passage matched your
query" tells a lawyer nothing about where the $3,000 figure came from. This
pass makes the ANSWER's own claims the citation unit: extract each factual
claim (parties, amounts, dates, terms), find the exact verbatim contract
language that establishes it, verify it character-for-character against the
source file, and pin it to the file + char span so the UI can anchor it inside
the opened document.

Whenever grounding succeeds, chunk-provenance citations are replaced with
these claim citations. It is strictly best-effort: any failure keeps the
chunk citations and never breaks the chat response.
