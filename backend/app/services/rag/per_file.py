"""Per-file map-reduce answering for folder-scoped chat.

When the user chats with a small set of files and the question is about the
files individually ("summarize each of these", "compare these agreements",
"which of these auto-renews?"), pooled retrieval is the wrong tool: the files
share one context window and a verbose file crowds out the rest.

This path gives EVERY scoped file its own context window: one map pass per
file (in parallel) answers the question for that file alone with exact
quotes, then a single reduce pass synthesizes the final answer with per-file
attribution. Same discipline as the authority mapper: hard file cap, quotes
come from the documents, and any failure falls back to the normal RAG answer
rather than breaking chat.
