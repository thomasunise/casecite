"""Per-message routing for the zero-controls composer.

The Matter Strategy chat has no mode toggles: the user just types. This module
decides, per message, whether the query is a grounded question (normal RAG),
a pure legal-research lookup (outside authority only — the user's documents
must NOT be read), or a strategy-type request (route to the full-coverage
strategy brief), and whether case-law authority would strengthen the answer.

The research/strategy line matters: "find case law supporting OUR case" needs
the matter read first; "find case law on DWI stops" does not — routing the
latter through the strategy brief drags every document into an answer the
user never asked them to be part of.

One tiny utility-LLM call; on any failure a keyword heuristic answers instead —
routing must never break a chat request.
