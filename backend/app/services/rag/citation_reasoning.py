"""Post-answer citation reasoning for the chat RAG pipeline.

After the answer is generated, ONE utility-LLM call (per chat request, not per
citation) explains WHY each cited source — internal document or case law —
supports the answer. The result is joined back onto the response citations as
an auditable `reasoning` chain plus a one-sentence `application`.

The prompt-building / parsing / joining helpers are pure functions so they can
be unit-tested without the app or a live LLM. The enrichment pass is strictly
best-effort: any failure leaves citations with empty reasoning and never breaks
the chat response.
