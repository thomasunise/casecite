"""
Audit Logging Service

Tamper-evident log of security-relevant events: each entry is HMAC-signed
over its full stored form and chained to the previous entry, written to daily
JSONL files with a best-effort database mirror.

Chain format history
--------------------
v1  HMAC over seven scalar fields.
v2  HMAC over the full stored entry. Builds that wrote v1/v2 linked each entry
    to its own provisional hash rather than to the entry stored before it, so
    those entries carry a valid signature but no usable linkage.
v3  (this build) HMAC over the full stored entry and the hash version, linked
    to the entry stored immediately before it.

Verification checks every entry's own HMAC whatever its version, and enforces
linkage from the first v3 entry onward: a v3 entry must point at the entry
stored before it, including the last legacy entry at the upgrade boundary. A
v1/v2 entry that follows a v3 entry is reported as tampering, and because the
version is inside the v3 HMAC an entry cannot be relabelled as legacy to
escape the linkage check. Logs written before the upgrade therefore keep
verifying (edits are still caught; removal of a legacy entry is not, as it
never was), and an upgraded instance starts without disabling
