"""Deep case-law research: read full opinions, keep only verified authority.

Shared engine behind two features:

- The strategy brief (``strategy.py``) uses the windowing / quote-verification
  helpers here for its per-point authority stage.
- Research-intent chat ("find me case law on X") calls
  :func:`research_authorities` — the question is decomposed into legal
  propositions, CourtListener candidates are read window by window (in full,
  up to MAX_WINDOWS_PER_OPINION windows), and only opinions whose supporting
  quote verifies verbatim against the real opinion text are returned, each
  with a one-sentence explanation of why it matters.
- Drafting, contract chat and the strategy brief use
  :func:`redact_unverified_case_references` so model-written prose there is
  held to the same no-invented-authority rule as chat.

The hard rule everywhere: a citation the model endorses but cannot ground in
the opinion's own text is dropped, never shown.
