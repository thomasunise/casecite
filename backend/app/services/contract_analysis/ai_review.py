"""AI-first contract review: the model reads THIS contract against THE USER'S
instructions and finds what matters — no fixed clause library required.

The seeded taxonomy/rules are supplementary detectors (cheap, deterministic,
well-grounded); this pass is the primary finder, because no canned library
covers every contract a firm sees. Same grounding bargain as everywhere else
in the pipeline: every finding must quote the offending text verbatim, the
quote must locate in the document, or the finding is discarded.
