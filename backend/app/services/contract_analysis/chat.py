"""Conversational contract review — natural language drives the machinery.

One endpoint, no form controls: the user's message is routed by intent —

- "review this" / "analyze" / "redline-worthy problems?"  -> the full
  analysis pipeline (``contract_analysis_service.analyze``), optionally
  steered by whatever review instructions the message itself contains.
- anything else ("is there a liability cap?", "check the termination
  rights", "summarize the indemnity") -> a grounded answer over the
  contract text, where every citation is a verbatim quote located in the
  document via ``find_quote_offset`` — unlocatable quotes are dropped, so
  the UI can highlight exactly what the answer relies on.
