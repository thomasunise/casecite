    CaseCite API — self-hosted legal research over your firm's documents.

    ## Features
    - Retrieval-augmented research chat with verified citations
    - Document management, indexing, and cloud-storage connectors
    - Contract analysis, redlining, and drafting
    - Case law, judge, and citation tools backed by CourtListener
    - Tamper-evident (HMAC-chained) audit trail

    ## Authentication
    Every endpoint requires a bearer token (or the session cookie) except:
    /health and /ready (probes; detail is admin-only), GET /api/v1/branding,
    GET /api/v1/csrf-token, the OAuth callback under /api/v1/connectors, and
    the sign-in endpoints under /api/v1/auth (login, register, refresh,
    password reset, MFA verify). /metrics requires an admin.
    Obtain one from POST /auth/login (email + password, optional TOTP MFA);
    an Azure AD SSO exchange is available at POST /auth/azure/login.
