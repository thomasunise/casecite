# Deployment Guide

This guide covers the three supported deployment modes for CaseCite.

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Use Case | Database | Reverse Proxy | Containers |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Development | Local dev | SQLite | None | 1 (backend) |
| Coolify | PaaS hosting | PostgreSQL (external) | Platform-managed | 1 (unified) |
| Production VPS | Self-hosted | PostgreSQL | Caddy (auto-HTTPS) | 4 |

---

## Development

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/thomasunise/casecite.git && cd casecite
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set one provider key (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY), or leave them all
# empty and save a personal key under Settings after signing in

# 2. Start backend (Docker)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# 3. Start frontend (hot-reload)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

---

## Coolify / Single Container

The unified `Dockerfile` builds both frontend and backend into one container with nginx serving static files and proxying API requests to uvicorn. It does **not** include PostgreSQL or Redis — provide both (managed services, or containers you run yourself) and terminate TLS in a reverse proxy in front of the container.

Production mode fails closed: every variable below is required, and the secrets must be **generated once and kept** — generating them inline on each `docker run` would make every document, stored API key and audit entry from the previous run unreadable.

```bash
# 1. Generate the secrets ONCE and keep the file (chmod 600; never commit it)
cat > casecite.env <<EOF
SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
ENCRYPTION_SALT=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
AUDIT_HMAC_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
REGISTRATION_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db-host:5432/casecite
DB_SSL=require
REDIS_URL=redis://:password@redis-host:6379/0
CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.yourfirm.com
ALLOWED_HOSTS=app.yourfirm.com
TRUSTED_PROXIES=<IP or CIDR of the reverse proxy in front of this container>
DISK_ENCRYPTION_ACKNOWLEDGED=true
EOF
chmod 600 casecite.env

# 2. Build and run. The named volume holds uploads, the vector index, audit
#    logs and the key store — without it they are lost when the container is
#    replaced.
docker build -t casecite .
docker run -d --name casecite -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 \
  --env-file casecite.env \
  -v casecite_data:/app/data \
  casecite
```

`DISK_ENCRYPTION_ACKNOWLEDGED=true` is a statement that the disks behind the data volume, the Postgres database and the Redis instance are encrypted — set it only once that is true. `DB_SSL=require` is for a database reached over a network; use `DB_SSL=internal` only for a Postgres on the same isolated Docker network. Redis must run with `maxmemory-policy noeviction` (see `docker-compose.prod.yml` for why).

For Coolify, follow [deploy/COOLIFY-SETUP.md](../deploy/COOLIFY-SETUP.md): it uses the root `docker-compose.yml`, which declares the persistent data volume. The health check endpoint is `GET /health`.

---

## Production VPS (Auto-HTTPS)

### Server setup

Any provider works the same way (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr,
on-prem). Minimum 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04+ LTS, public IPv4, your SSH
key installed. Point a DNS A record (`casecite.yourfirm.com → SERVER_IP`) at it
before starting the stack so Caddy can obtain a certificate.

```bash
ssh root@SERVER_IP
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh          # Docker + Compose v2
apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/thomasunise/casecite.git /opt/casecite
cd /opt/casecite
```

Before going live, have to hand: the domain and DNS control; each provider
API key the firm will use (the install brings its own keys); for SSO, the
Azure AD tenant ID and app registration; for connectors, the OAuth client
credentials of each service; the firm's data- and audit-retention policy; and
host-level encryption on the disk that holds Docker's volumes.
`DISK_ENCRYPTION_ACKNOWLEDGED` is a promise you are making about **three**
volumes, not one: `rag_data` (uploads, vector index, audit logs),
`postgres_data` (chat history, analyses, clause text) and `redis_data` (job
results). Encrypting `/var/lib/docker` (LUKS, or the provider's encrypted
disk) covers all three.

```bash
# 1. Generate .env with fresh secrets (written with mode 0600; refuses to
#    overwrite an existing .env)
python3 scripts/setup_production.py --create-env --domain app.yourfirm.com
# Review .env. Once the disk is encrypted, set DISK_ENCRYPTION_ACKNOWLEDGED=true
# (or pass --disk-encrypted above).

# 2. Validate configuration
python3 scripts/setup_production.py --validate

# 3. Start all services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Copy `SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_SALT` and `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` from `.env` into a
password manager or secrets vault now. They are not in any backup, and a
restore without them cannot decrypt the documents, the stored API keys or the
MFA secrets.

### Create the admin account

The first account registered on a fresh instance becomes the admin. In
production that registration is refused unless it carries the
`REGISTRATION_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` from `.env`, so nobody else who reaches the new
instance can claim the admin role:

```bash
DOMAIN=app.yourfirm.com
CSRF=$(curl -s -c /tmp/casecite.jar "https://$DOMAIN/api/v1/csrf-token" \
  | python3 -c 'import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["csrf_token"])')
curl -s -b /tmp/casecite.jar -H "X-CSRF-Token: $CSRF" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email": "you@yourfirm.com", "name": "Your Name",
       "password": "<12+ chars, upper, lower, number, symbol>",
       "bootstrap_token": "<REGISTRATION_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN from .env>"}' \
  "https://$DOMAIN/api/v1/auth/register"
rm /tmp/casecite.jar
```

Then sign in at `https://$DOMAIN`, enrol MFA, and invite the rest of the firm
from Settings → Users. Self-service registration stays off
(`ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false`) unless you turn it on.

This starts 4 services:
- **caddy** — Reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- **postgres** — PostgreSQL 16 database
- **redis** — Redis 7 for sessions, rate limiting, and token revocation
- **backend** — Application server (nginx + uvicorn)

### DNS Setup

Point your domain's A record to your server's IP. Caddy handles certificate provisioning automatically once DNS resolves.

Set the `DOMAIN` environment variable in `.env`:
```
DOMAIN=app.yourfirm.com
```

### Resource Requirements

- **Minimum**: 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 20 GB SSD
- **Recommended**: 4 CPU, 8 GB RAM, 50 GB SSD (for larger document corpora)

## Health Checks

All deployment modes expose these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /health` | Application health (returns `{"status": "healthy"}`; per-component detail only for an authenticated admin) |
| `GET /ready` | Readiness check (database connectivity) |
| `GET /metrics` | Basic metrics (uptime, request counts) — requires an admin bearer token in production |

The container healthchecks probe these over loopback (`http://localhost/...`).
`localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are always accepted as `Host` values for that
reason, in addition to whatever `ALLOWED_HOSTS` lists.

---

## Scaling Considerations

**CaseCite currently runs as exactly one backend process.** The app refuses to
start when `UVICORN_WORKERS` is set to anything other than `1` (or unset),
whatever `VECTOR_DB` is, and the same constraint applies to running more than
one container replica behind a single URL. Switching the vector database to
Pinecone does **not** lift it.

Three stores are process-local and are not safe to share between workers or
replicas:

| Store | Where | What breaks with two processes |
|-------|-------|--------------------------------|
| Session store | `middleware/security.py` `SessionManager` — in-memory dict mirrored to `data/sessions.jsonl` | Logins, logouts and "terminate all sessions" only take effect in the process that handled them |
| Document registry | `services/documents.py` — `data/uploads/index.json` is read once per process and rewritten whole on every change | Processes overwrite each other's uploads and deletions; documents "index" and can never be found |
| Connector caches | `services/connectors/*` — per-process credential/state caches | Token refreshes in one process are invisible to the others |

(The embedded Chroma store is a fourth, but it is the only one Pinecone fixes.)

Horizontal scaling therefore needs those stores moved to Redis/Postgres first —
this is tracked in `ROADMAP.md` under "Multi-worker / multi-replica
deployments". Until then, scale vertically (CPU/RAM for the single container)
and keep `UVICORN_WORKERS` unset.

PostgreSQL and Redis themselves already support multi-instance deployments, so
once the app-side stores move there, the remaining steps are: switch to Pinecone
(`VECTOR_DB=pinecone`, `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`,
`PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`), raise `UVICORN_WORKERS` (read by `start.sh`), and put a
load balancer in front of the replicas.

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Application (image tag)

`docker-compose.prod.yml` runs `CASECITE_IMAGE:CASECITE_TAG` (default: the
image CI publishes to GHCR, tagged with each commit's full SHA and `latest`).
Rolling back is choosing an earlier tag — the frontend is copied out of the
same image, so it rolls back with the backend.

```bash
# 1. Find the tag you were running before (the CD workflow records it in .env;
#    otherwise: docker images ghcr.io/thomasunise/casecite)
grep CASECITE_TAG .env

# 2. Start the previous build. Postgres, Redis and the data volume are untouched.
CASECITE_TAG=<previous-sha> docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull backend frontend-build
CASECITE_TAG=<previous-sha> docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 3. Make it stick for later `up -d` runs
sed -i 's/^CASECITE_TAG=.*/CASECITE_TAG=<previous-sha>/' .env

# 4. Verify
curl -sf https://app.yourfirm.com/health
```

If the release you are leaving added a database migration, decide whether to
keep it (the older code ignores tables and columns it does not know about —
usually fine) or roll it back too (below, **before** starting the old image).
When in doubt, restore the pre-deploy backup instead.

### Database migration

```bash
# Roll back the most recent migration (runs inside the backend container)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic downgrade -1

# Or to a specific revision
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

### Backup before every deploy

```bash
./scripts/backup_database.sh                                    # database + data volume
./scripts/restore_database.sh backups/casecite_<ts>.sql.gz \
    --data backups/rag_data_<ts>.tar.gz --yes                   # if the deploy goes wrong
```

---

## Backups

`scripts/backup_database.sh` runs on the **host**, from the directory that
holds `docker-compose.prod.yml` (the backend image ships neither `pg_dump` nor
the script). It produces two files per run, encrypts both with
`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and writes a `.sha256` checksum next to each. It
**refuses to run without `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** — the archives contain
client text, chat history and password hashes — unless you set
`BACKUP_ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED=true` because the backup target is itself encrypted:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `casecite_<ts>.sql.gz` | PostgreSQL: users, matters, chat history, analyses, audit-log mirror |
| `rag_data_<ts>.tar.gz` | the `/app/data` volume: uploaded documents (encrypted at rest), ChromaDB vector index, audit-log chain, BYOK key store, sessions, instance secrets |

```bash
# Daily at 02:00 — put BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY (and S3_* if used) in the cron
# environment or a file sourced by it, not on the command line.
0 2 * * * cd /opt/casecite && ./scripts/backup_database.sh >> /var/log/casecite-backup.log 2>&1
```

Keep `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` somewhere other than this server (password
manager, KMS). Without it the `.enc` files are unrecoverable, and with it on
the same disk the encryption protects nothing. Do not put it in the
deployment's `.env`: that file is injected into the backend container.

**What a backup does not contain.** `.env` is not backed up. `SECRET_KEY`,
`ENCRYPTION_SALT` and `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` must be escrowed separately (password
manager, secrets vault): without the first two, a restored instance cannot
decrypt uploaded documents, stored API keys, connector tokens or MFA secrets;
without the third, the restored audit log fails verification at startup.

While the data volume is archived the backend container is paused (requests
wait) so the vector index is captured in a consistent state; set
`BACKUP_PAUSE_BACKEND=false` to skip that. Local files and S3 copies older
than `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 30) are deleted. Content a user deletes
therefore remains recoverable from backups for up to that long — set the
retention to match the firm's deletion policy.

Managed/external Postgres: set `BACKUP_MODE=direct` with `POSTGRES_HOST`,
`POSTGRES_USER`, `PGPASSWORD` and `pg_dump` on the host, plus `DATA_VOLUME`
(docker volume name) or `DATA_DIR` (host path) so the data volume is still
archived.

**Restore** — always from the same run, otherwise document records and their
vectors drift out of sync. The script first verifies both archives (checksum,
then a full decrypt and integrity pass) and only then stops the backend,
recreates the database, restores the dump and (with `--data`) the volume, and
starts the backend, which applies any pending migrations. The instance must be
running with the original `SECRET_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_SALT` and `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`:

```bash
BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=… ./scripts/restore_database.sh \
    backups/casecite_<ts>.sql.gz.enc --data backups/rag_data_<ts>.tar.gz.enc --yes
```

Test a restore onto a scratch host at least quarterly; a backup that has
never been restored is a hope, not a backup.

## TLS on Internal Networks

Firms deploying on a LAN or VPN without public DNS can't use Let's Encrypt.
Three options, each a small `Caddyfile` change inside the site block:

**Option 1 — Caddy's internal CA (zero config, self-signed):**

```caddy
{$DOMAIN:localhost} {
    tls internal
    # ... rest of the site block unchanged
}
```

Caddy creates a local root CA and issues certificates from it. Browsers warn
until you install that root CA on client machines; export it from the caddy
container at `/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt`. This is also what
happens automatically for a `DOMAIN=localhost` trial — the certificate warning
on first visit is expected.

**Option 2 — bring your own certificate (corporate CA or purchased):**

```caddy
{$DOMAIN} {
    tls /etc/caddy/certs/casecite.crt /etc/caddy/certs/casecite.key
    # ... rest of the site block unchanged
}
```

Mount the files in `docker-compose.prod.yml` under the `caddy` service:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/etc/caddy/certs:ro
```

**Option 3 — internal ACME server (e.g. smallstep, corporate ACME):**

```caddy
{$DOMAIN} {
    tls {
        ca https://ca.internal.example.com/acme/acme/directory
    }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**The app won't start** — `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend`.
Production fails closed on purpose: the log names the missing or placeholder
setting (`SECRET_KEY`, `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_SALT`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`,
`REDIS_PASSWORD`, `DISK_ENCRYPTION_ACKNOWLEDGED`, `CORS_ORIGINS`). A provider
key is not required to boot — users can each save their own under Settings. An
`AUDIT ENTRY HMAC MISMATCH` at boot means the audit chain failed verification —
see `docs/secret-rotation.md` before overriding it.

**No certificate / browser warning** — Caddy needs DNS to resolve to this
server and ports 80/443 reachable from the internet. `docker compose -f
docker-compose.prod.yml logs caddy` shows the ACME exchange. On a LAN with no
public DNS, see "TLS on Internal Networks" above.

**Users see 429 or get locked out together** — `TRUSTED_PROXIES` does not
match the proxy in front of the backend, so every client resolves to one IP.
The bundled stack pins it; behind Coolify/Traefik set it to the proxy's subnet.

**Out of memory** — `docker stats`; the backend is capped at 4 GB in the
compose file. OCR and large PDF extraction are the usual culprits; raise the
limit or the VPS size.

## Monitoring

### Logs

```bash
# All services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Backend only
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f backend

# Caddy access logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec caddy cat /data/access.log
```

### Audit Logs

Audit logs are stored in `/app/data/audit_logs/` inside the backend container, one `audit_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` file per UTC day. Each entry carries an HMAC-SHA256 hash chained to the previous entry, so an edited, removed or reordered entry is detectable. Admins can also read and verify the log in the product (Settings → Audit Log) or over the API (`GET /api/v1/admin/audit/logs`, `GET /api/v1/admin/audit/verify`).

```bash
# View today's audit log
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend \
  sh -c 'head -20 /app/data/audit_logs/audit_$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl'
```
