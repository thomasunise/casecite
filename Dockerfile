# Multi-stage Dockerfile for Coolify deployment
# Stage 1: Build frontend with Vite
# Stage 2: Serve both backend API and frontend from one container

# ---- Stage 1: Frontend Build ----
# Base images float on the minor line on purpose (node:20, python:3.11): a
# rebuild picks up OS security fixes, and Trivy gates the image in CI, so a
# digest pin that nobody bumps means a permanently red build job. For a fully
# reproducible build, replace the tags with `image@sha256:<digest>` (resolve
# with `docker buildx imagetools inspect <image>`); Dependabot's docker
# ecosystem (.github/dependabot.yml) will then propose digest bumps.

# No USER directive on purpose: start.sh must begin as root to chown the mounted
# /app/data volume (Docker/Coolify create named volumes root-owned) and to let
# nginx bind :80. It then drops privileges: nginx workers run as appuser (see
# the nginx.conf edit above) and uvicorn — the only process that touches client
# data — is started as appuser via gosu. start.sh refuses to start if the drop
# does not work. Alembic migrations run before the drop and touch only the
# database.
