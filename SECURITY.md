| Latest release | Yes |
| Older releases | No — upgrade to the latest |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately, not in a public issue or pull request.

1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting for this repository:
   <https://github.com/thomasunise/casecite/security/advisories/new>
2. Include a description, the affected version or commit, steps to reproduce,
   the impact you expect, and a suggested fix if you have one.
3. You will get an acknowledgement in the advisory thread. The project is
   maintained by a small team, so allow a few business days; the aim is an
   initial assessment within a week.
4. Please give us the chance to ship a fix before disclosing publicly. You will
   be credited in the advisory unless you ask not to be.

If you operate a CaseCite instance and suspect it has been compromised, that is
an incident in *your* deployment — follow [docs/incident-response.md](docs/incident-response.md).

## Security Architecture

This section describes what the code does. It is not a certification: CaseCite
is self-hosted software, and the operator is responsible for the host, the
network, disk encryption, backups and the firm's own policies. No SOC 2, ISO
27001 or HIPAA attestation is claimed or implied.

### Authentication
- Email + password with PBKDF2-SHA256 (600,000 iterations, per-password salt).
  Passwords must be 12+ characters with upper, lower, number and symbol.
- TOTP multi-factor authentication with recovery codes. Optional per user by
  default; `REQUIRE_MFA=true` makes it mandatory for every password account. An
  admin can reset a user's MFA (lost device); the user's sessions are ended.
  Disabling MFA requires the account password as well as a valid code.
- Accounts created by an admin get a temporary password and must change it at
  first sign-in.
- Azure AD single sign-on (RS256, JWKS validation, tenant-pinned) is available
  as a backend token exchange. There is no SAML, generic OIDC or SCIM support.
- JWT access tokens (HS256, 60-minute expiry) and rotating refresh tokens,
  delivered in httpOnly, `SameSite=Strict` cookies.
- Token revocation by JTI in Redis (required in production). "Sign out
  everywhere", password change, password reset, role change and deactivation
  invalidate every outstanding access and refresh token for the account.
- Sessions: at most 5 concurrent per user, an absolute lifetime of 8 hours
  (`SESSION_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT_HOURS`) and an idle timeout of 2 hours
  (`SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`). Refreshing a token does not extend the
  absolute lifetime.
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts in 15 minutes, with backoff.
- Session IP binding is available (`ENFORCE_SESSION_IP_BINDING`) and off by
  default.

### Authorization
- Four roles (admin, attorney, paralegal, viewer) mapped to permissions that an
  admin can adjust per role. Admin-only operations are gated by
  `require_permission("admin.*")`.
- Every document, chat, analysis and job is scoped to its owner (or to the
  members of the matter it is filed under). The vector store refuses a query
  that carries no tenant scope.
- There are no ethical walls beyond matter membership, and no per-document
  ACLs. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Data Protection
- Application-layer AES-256-GCM encryption for uploaded document originals,
  stored API keys (BYOK), connector OAuth tokens and TOTP secrets, with
  per-record keys derived via HKDF.
- **Not** application-encrypted: the vector index (document text chunks), the
  database (chat history, analyses, extracted clause text) and Redis (job
  results). These rely on disk encryption that the operator provides; the app
  refuses to start in production until `DISK_ENCRYPTION_ACKNOWLEDGED=true`.
- BYOK keys are stored server-side, shown to users only in masked form, and
  never returned to the browser.
- Document text and questions are sent to the AI providers the operator
  configures. See [docs/subprocessors.md](docs/subprocessors.md) for every
  outbound data flow and how to keep inference on your own network.
- `SECRET_KEY` cannot be rotated without re-encrypting or re-uploading stored
  documents; see [docs/secret-rotation.md](docs/secret-rotation.md).

### Web Security
- CSRF protection via double-submit cookies with HMAC signatures
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- HSTS with 1-year max-age
- X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Permissions-Policy
- Host-header allowlist (`ALLOWED_HOSTS`) and an explicit CORS origin list

### Rate Limiting
Per client IP, resolved through `TRUSTED_PROXIES`:
- Default: 100 requests/minute
- Chat: 20 requests/minute
- Login: 3 attempts per 5 minutes
- Registration: 3 per 5 minutes
- MFA verify / enable / disable: 5 per 5 minutes

### Deployment Recommendations
- `REGISTRATION_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` is required in production to create the first
  (admin) account, so an attacker who finds a fresh instance cannot claim it.
- Keep `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` (the default) unless the instance runs on a
  trusted network.
- Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the reverse proxy's address so rate limits, lockout
  and audit entries see real client IPs.
- Run exactly one backend process (the app enforces this) and run Redis with
  `maxmemory-policy noeviction`.
- Encrypt backups and keep `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`,
  `ENCRYPTION_SALT` and `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` off the server.

### Audit Trail
- 43 event types covering authentication, user administration, documents,
  exports, matter membership, connectors, settings and security events are
  recorded as JSONL, one file per UTC day. Admins can read, verify and export
  the log (Settings → Audit Log; `GET /api/v1/admin/audit/export`).
- By default a failed audit write is logged at CRITICAL and the request
  proceeds; `AUDIT_FAIL_CLOSED=true` fails the request instead, so nothing
  happens without an audit record.
- Each entry carries an HMAC-SHA256 hash (keyed with `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY`) chained
  to the previous entry. The chain is verified at startup and on demand
  (`GET /api/v1/admin/audit/verify`); in production the app refuses to start if
  verification fails.
- The key lives on the same host as the log, so the chain detects edits,
  deletions and reordering by anyone without the key, not by a host
  administrator. Forward the log to external storage if you need that
  (not built in — see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).
- Retention: files are compressed after `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90) and
  deleted after twice that. Raise it if your policy requires longer.

## Dependencies

- Python dependencies are installed from `backend/requirements.lock`, an exact,
  hash-pinned lock generated from `backend/requirements.txt`.
- CI runs `pip-audit` against that lock, `npm audit` on production frontend
  dependencies, Bandit, gitleaks, CodeQL, and a blocking Trivy scan of the
  built image. Dependabot opens update PRs weekly.
- Advisories that are knowingly accepted are listed, with the reason, in the
  `pip-audit` step of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and in `.trivyignore`.
